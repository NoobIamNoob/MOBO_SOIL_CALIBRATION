# MOBO_SOIL_CALIBRATION
FLIPROSE is a Finite Element Method (FEM) program that utilizes the Strain Space Multiple Mechanism Soil Constitutive Model to analyze the liquefaction behavior of sandy soil. It incorporates Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization (using AX and BoTorch) to identify an optimal set of liquefaction parameters calibrated against cyclic loading test data.
